# Exchange Rate Tool

This tool fetches the HBAR - USD exchange rate from all the exchanges that allow HBAR trading and calculates their weighted median [Weight is the volume of HABR - USD trading occurred on that exchange in the last 24 hours].
Once the Median is calculated we perform a smoothing operation to keep the rate in bound from the rate at previous midnight.
This Smoothed Median is then pushed to the Hedera Network[can push to multiple Hedera Networks in a single run] as the rate that is to be used for the next hour as the base for fee calculations for all transactions.

Currently 3 ERT instances run.
Instance 1 pushes rates to Mainnet
Instance 2 pushes rates to Stable Testnet
Instance 3 pushes rates to Preview Testnet, Staging-lg, Staging-sm, Integration and Performance Testing

We periodically [hourly] run this tool using AWS lambda.

This tool also provides 2 APIs.

1. ExchangeRateAPI - This gives the latest exchange rate that this tool has pushed to the Hedera Network.
2. ExchnageRateHistoryAPI - This gives the data from the previous runs which includes
    * All the data from exchanges that it fetched.
    * The median it calculated.
    * If that median is smoothed.
    * Previous Midnight Rate.


 Exchanges that we are currently pulling latest HBAR-USD exchange rate from:
  * Coinbase
  * Binance
  * Bitmart
