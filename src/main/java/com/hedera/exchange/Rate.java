     * within the bound. The new Rate will have the same hbarEquiv as newRate, but its centEquiv will be closer to the
     * one in oldRate.
     *
     * In other words, newC is adjusted if needed, so that these are both satisfied:

     * it needs to be a strict > to avoid errors. This means that if newC is clipped to that lower value,
     * and if the division is exact, then it will end up being one greater than it could have been. (To use the
     * more exact bound would be more complicated, and doesn't really make a practical difference).
     *
     * Note that this will return unpredictable results if the bounds would exceed the range of an int. Imagine creating
     * a new Rate with the same hbarEquiv as newRate, but with its centEquiv set to the centEquiv of the oldRate
     * increased or decreased by the maximum allowed by the bound. In that case, if the centEquiv overflows an int, then
     * the result returned by this method will be incorrect. That is unlikely to happen in practice, unless
     * hbarEquiv is too close to 0 or to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  So an hbarEquiv in the middle of the range is best. A
     * choice of 30,000 works well if hbarEquiv is an int.
